![Wave_Money_Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbtimqb5y/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,dpr_2.0,c_limit/v1608297045/WaveMoney/14_fairer-future-myanmar_xskhoz.jpg)

### When was the company incorporated?

 Established in November 2016 as a joint venture between Norwegian mobile operator Telenor Group, Yoma Bank, and SGX-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings (YSH) and Yangon-listed First Myanmar Investment (FMI), the last three related entities of Serge Pun's Myanmar property, industry and finance onglomerate.  [0] It is 'Myanmar’s first mobile financial service provider and now the largest mobile money platform in the country'[1].

### Who are the founders of the company?

Telenor is a 166 year old 'Norwegian majority state-owned multinational telecommunications company headquartered at Fornebu in Bærum, close to Oslo. It is one of the world's largest mobile telecommunications companies with operations worldwide, but focused in Scandinavia and Asia'[2]. In Mynmar Telenor has 747 employees (as at 2020) with 16.23 million mobile subscriptions. 

Telenor passed a major milestone with the signing of the nationwide telecommunications license agreement with the Myanmar government on 30 January 2014. Telenor was declared a successful application for the license on June 27, 2013, followed by a license negotiation process. [3] In July 2020, Telenor announced its divestment of Wave Money to Yoma Strategic Holdings (Wave Holdco) while still remaining a strategic partner for its Telenor Myanmar communications services. 

Property mogul Serge Pun chairs Yoma Strategic Holdings, a Singapore-listed outfit with real estate holdings in his native Myanmar. Pun is the son of a Chinese-born banker, who left Myanmar with his family in 1965 for Beijing. Through his subsidiaries Yoma Bank and First Myanmar Investments, Pun holds majority control of the Wave Money business in 2021.

Yoma Bank has among the largest branch networks in Myanmar. Yoma Bank Limited is one of Myanmar's largest commercial banking companies founded in 1993, the 4th-biggest bank in Myanmar in 25 cities, it is led by New Zealander Dean Cleland with 80 branches across Myanmar, 3000 employees and was founded by Serge Pun.  

First Myanmar Investment (FMI), located in Pabedan Township, Yangon, is a major Myanmar investment company founded in 1992 as one of Myanmar's first publicly traded companies, with interests in financial services, healthcare and 87% of revenues coming from real estate [4][5][6][7].

An assessment of the top 10 conglomerates of Myanmar found Yoma Strategic Holdngs (and its leading in-country company First Myanmar Investment Group), to be comparatively low in connection to and potential cronyism with the military government, while being comparartively high in foreign contacts, and medium to high in competence and strategy. [8]

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

 A 2015 Asian Development Bank Economics Working Paper indicated that 'rural areas have limited access to banking services, and bank lending to agriculture is largely restricted to the state-owned Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, which faces financial and operational challenges of its own and covers only a small share of the financing needs of farmers [9]. The country has had a continuing and relentless history of economic shocks stretching back from its foundation in in 1948, exacerbated by the military coups from 1962 onwards, culminating in the latest unrest and violence in February 2021 to now[10].
 
 The legacy of Myanmar's past has included nationalisation of banks, de-monetization, partial liberalisation and the expansion of banks, the banking crisis of 2004, the bank closure of Univesal Bank and minicrisis of 2012 with a run on KBZ bank further destabilising the finance sector. All this history provided a complete lack of public trust in the banking system. As a joint venture company, Wave Money was founded to offer customers online mobile banking and at the heart of it's offer, the convenience of sending and receiving money instantly and safely throughout Myanmar.

Yoma Bank itself, the part owner of Wave Money, was the second largest private bank in 2003, but following the banking crisis of that year, had to resort to emergency financing from the Central Bank of Mynmar and consequently had its operations restricted to remittance transfers only. These restictions were lifted in 2012 allowing Yoma to joint venture in Wave Money in 2015 [11]. 

In 2021, Yoma Bank is one of the Myanmar’s largest private banks employing more than 3,000 people. Self described, 'established in 1993, Yoma Bank strategic direction 'aims to become a leader in serving the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) sector, and reach businesses that significantly contribute to the local economy and build up local communities.' [12] 

Hence, an opportunity to launch Wave Money as a mobile banking platform to its customers together the backing of Telenor, a telecommunications and technology company experienced in developing Asian markets, is assumed to have been a natural fit, and a perfect opportunity.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Wave Money was established in 2015/2016 with a 51% stake by Telenor, with the remaining stake owned by the Serge Pun related companies Yoma and FMI. Telenor sold its entire stake to Yoma Strategic Holdings for US$76.5m in 2020 as a divestment strategy to focus on telecoms [13]. 

As a joint venture, it is difficult to find exact numbers for the intial seeding of Wave Money. A review of Telenor financials statements from 2016, only finds a comment that, 'in emerging Asia, solid revenue growth was fuelled by increasing data consumption; while we continued to focus on network roll-outs and saw Myanmar turning cash flow positive, only two years after service launch' to rapidly become the #2 operator in the country. There appears to be no specific investment number.

A review of the Yoma Bank 2016 financial statements however, sprukes the Wave Money platform as the first licenced mobile money service in Myanmar, the largest and wide spread platform with an estimated market penetration to be over 70%, and importantly, Yoma and Wave interchangeable services including account linkage, direct fund transfer and Yoma account withdrawals through Wave vendors [12]. Page 77 refers to a 2,364,930,800 MMK investment securities in Myanmar Digital Money "Available for Sale Securities' which converts to approximately at 1262 MMK per US dollar on 30/9/2016 cross rates (xe.com historical rates tables) at USD$1.84m. Yoma has since purchased a controlling stake of 51% in June 2020 for USD$76.5m.

In May 2020 it was announced that Chinese based Alibaba Alipay operator Ant Group would become a strategic investor in Wave Money, a deal that will be completed on final regulatory approval, bringing a USDS$73.5 investment for 33% of the company [14]. While Telenor was the major technology development partner for the venture, with the mobile infrastructure established, the divestment and change over to Ant group ownership would bring financial tehcnology expertise to support the further growth of the Wave Money business. Telenor and Ant Group have shared JV interests in Pakistan. 

As at May 2021, the planned investment by Ant Group into Wave Money has fallen through, with the continued unrest in Myanmar which commenced in February, with no resolution in sight at this time (May 2021). Yoma Bank has since announced that the long stop dates (long stop dates are where if contractual conditions are not ultimately fulfilled by the due dates, automatically termination of the contract occurs) on the transactions in relation to Wave Money with Ant Financial and Yoma Strategic will not be extended due to the unrest in Myanmar. The agreements were announced on 24 June 2020 but have not yet been completed, and the parties will continue to evaluate the situation, but not be formally bound by the agreements after 30 April 2021.

## Business Activities
#
### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company originally hoped to revolutionlise mobile financial services in one of Asia's poorest countries, headed by CEO Brad Jones, an ex-NAB former director of mobile money and innovation at VISA Singapore, by offering free app based funds transfer across the country. Wave Money states its vision is "Creating a fairer future for Myanmar, empower Myanmar people with the freedom to manage their money the way they most prefer". 

![wave_money_shop](https://wavemoney.com.mm/assets/img/about-us/mission.png)

### Introducing basic financial online services to everyday people

Wave Money aims at the banking basics, utlilising online technologies to "provide reliable, simple, affordable, and trustworthy financial services which can be conveniently accessed via mobile phones and our extensive agent network", in a country where banking trust is low, and infrastructure such as utilities, roads and technology are underdeveloped, and movement of money is difficult, with a low trust in cash. [15] Prior to 2014, Myanmar had extremely limited and archaic mobile infrastructure with a penetration of 7% of the population. In 2013, after the government committed to expanding the mobile network, penetration grew to 50% by 2015 after the country quickly adopted 2G, then 3G within twelve months, before rolling out 4G, providing the foundation for rapid fintech expansion [16]. By November 2016, there were over 30 million (out 53 million people) telecommunications subscribers in Myanmar serviced by three operators: the Government-owned MPT, Norway-based Telenor and Qatar-based Ooredoo [17].

A review of the Telenor financial statements in 2014 posted 'Perhaps this year’s greatest transformation happened in Myanmar, where millions of people discovered the power of mobile connectivity. It is here, in this relatively untapped market, that we can truly see the enormous impact of a mobile phone and how it can empower societies. Myanmar has skipped the traditional development path seen in more mature markets and is leapfrogging directly into the digital age. The Internet is mobile, and with it comes both economic and social possibilities with tremendous development potential." From this enormous takeup, a credible safe method of transferring money for everyday indviduals was solved, in a country where in 2016, greater than 66% of the people lived in rural areas [18].

### Supporting women's rights and economic development

In June 2018, with support from the United Nations Capital Development Fund and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Wave Money launched Shwe Toe, "a financial education gamification app that aims to help young women with a better understanding of financial concepts". And then in March 2019, Wave Money collaborated with Myanmar Economic Bank to provide mobile pension payments to government pensioners.[18a]

As of September 2019, Wave Money had over 68,000 agents in almost every region in Myanmar. In 2020 with the acceleration of the COVID pandemic, safe and easy acess to funds via the app saw a the business grow exponentially further until February 2021 this year, when the military goverment commenced a nationwide violent crackdown on population unrest.

 ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

FMI's 2016 financial statements announced 'Future Launch of Wave Money The Company, Yoma Bank, and our joint venture partner Telenor are planning to launch the revolutionary Wave Money mobile payment platform. Wave Money allows customers to securely store and transfer money using just their mobile phones. After downloading the Wave Money mobile app, customers can visit a nearby Wave Shop to deposit or withdraw cash. Wave Shops include local grocery stores, mobile phone shops, teashops and convenience stores. Wave Money is available 24/7 on your phone, so there’s no need to wait for the bank to open to transfer money. Transactions are processed instantly, resulting in a fast, efficient service [18].

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The competitive advantage that Wave Money has demonstrated is their ability to bring together Telenor, a world class mobile technology with a track history of installations in developing countries, a local conglomerate owned by Serge Pun in his FMI group and Yoma Bank subsidiaries, vast multi-industry interests and one of the largest banks in the bank networks in the country, combined with a simple and effective online app allowing peope to move money freely across the country to family and businesses, and agents to make commissions on withdrawals in exchanges for cash. Telenor had first moved advantage in 2014 with Wave Money and operating in 18 months, and by the end of 2014, Telenor Myanmar, as the second largest mobile provider, had 3.4 million mobile subscribers to support its adoption of Wave Money [19].

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The implementation of mobile and mobile Internet infrastructure is particularly important for Myanmar given that in 2015 given that less than 10% of the 53 million population had bank accounts, reflecting their distrust of the banking industry [20]. The 2015 Telenor financial statements reveal "Financial services: During the year, Telenor launched digital mobile money in its newest market Myanmar. Commercial testing commenced in December and financial services will be offered through 800 point-of-sales under the brand “Wave Money”. The implementation of Wave Money Agents providing every day businesses and individuals the opportunity to provide deposit and withdrawal services on a commission basis, has generated a high degree uptake across the country. After safe transfer of money, the ability to make money in a very poor country via agency commission continued to drive growth.

The 2015 Telenor report goes in to say 'A country like Myanmar, where [suitable] internet connectivity was made widely available over mobile networks only in late 2014, access is already comparable to advanced markets like Malaysia and Sweden', and reported positive EDITDA only a few months after service launch[20]. Telenor state their expansion continues to be driven by M2M technology or 'machine-to-machine', which is "a broad label that can be used to describe any technology that enables networked devices to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of humans. ... M2M has since found applications in other sectors, such as healthcare, business and insurance" togther with their "core bank technology"[19][20a][20b][20c].

From FMI's 2016 financial statements, '...Myanmar’s financial sector will benefit from global trends in technology and innovation. We have laid the foundations for future growth through the procurement of a new core banking system and the development of our partnership with Telenor to establish Wave Money. Yoma Bank expects to use digital channels to offer modern banking services to improve financial inclusion across Myanmar in an affordable and convenient manner. The efficiencies of technology allow the bank to scale its offering to those that have not traditionally been able to access interest bearing products or receive credit (page 23)' [18].

By June 2020, the comparatively low tech approach of Wave Pay using 'super app' provides fintech services such as e-wallet top ups, local remittances through Pay Wave and over-the-counter services at Wave Money shops (agents scattered around Myanmar) [21].
#
## Landscape
#
### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Wave Money operates in the mobile financial services provider, a subset of the Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking domain. It operates directly in the banking transaction space, disrupting traditional banking services, providing useful services with minimal set up and hassle for end users, reflecting the changing mobile nature of personal banking [22].

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

BDO Austraiia reported that post COVID transforming customer behaviour, the top three trends in fintech includes [23]:
* Disruption in the payments sector "with contactless payments skyrocketing", mobile acccess driving growth in the unbanked and underbanked regions, rise in prepaid card growth and buy now-pay later (Afterpay etc);
* The galatic growth in digital banking solutions and the rise of fintech financial services which adapt and change quickly with rising and falling consumer needs and sentiments; and
* Banking as a Service (BaaS) for small to medium businesses, non-bank and new bank fintech startups riding the BaaS availability to offer end to ends services without the bricks and mortar overheads of traditional banks. Other areas such as tech giants entering the market with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Amazon Loans and Shopify merchant accounts.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?

A 2018 fintech review by Fintech Review Singapore found a relatively low fintech startup rate in Mymanmar as compared to Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore. However owing the low trust of banks (only 20% bank accountant adoption by 2018), other digital and mobile payments launched to secure market share, as listed on the following map [24][25]:

![Fintech_competition_Myanmar](\Fintech-startups-in-Myanmar-768x574.png)

* Qatar's Ooredoo mobile provider (Telenor's direct competitor) and CB Bank launching M-Pitesan, with similar offerings to Wave Money as direct competitors;
* OK Dollar focusing on the mobile payments to purchase products and services (movie tickets, take away, online shopping etc);
* True Money from Thailand focusing on cross border payments as opposed to internal payments focus on Wave Money; and
* MyPay, based on the acquired Fastacash from Singapore which includes mobile payments and a social platform.
* In 2020, KBZ, the country's leading bank, launched a digital partnership with Huawei, who are very strong on the digital side.
NearMe is leading the transition of offline payment solutions with smart point-of-sale terminals in its partner stores, including Myanmar's largest chain G&G Convenience [26]

## Results
#

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Wave Money continued triple year in growth-on-growth from 2016 to 2021, transferring an estimated $8 billion by the end of 2020 with over half the population subscribed, and 64,000 shops/agents engaged. This number dropped to 10 to 15% of transactions following the military action this year, but has similarly affected competition. In a relatively short time, the company has almost replaced banks as the go-to pseudo banking transaction payment and transaction platform for small businesses and individuals [27].

Telenor refected on both its business and share in Wave Money in its 2016 financial statements that, "at the same time [with our success] we must be aware of the possible challenges related to the increased use of mobile and internet services. Issues related to privacy, cyber-security and political monitoring are all high on the global agenda. These are complex issues that need to be handled by our industry and society at large. 

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

 The key to this early success was the collaboration between the country's second largest mobile communications company, Telenor, and the country's fourth largest bank, Yoma, using a wide network of existing branches to support the rollout, and recruiting and utilising a large network of small businesses on an agency basis to facilitate the conversion of online money to cash in hand.  Wave Money's success has been tied closely to the adoption of mobile internet within the country. This rapid technology adoption and expansion in Myanmar paved the way for the launch of further financial services for Wave Money.

 Key performance indicators include number of subscribers "30-day active users, number of unique customers, coverage in tersm opf agency adoption and geographic spread, and total funds transferred, resulting in agency fees, and government program, adoptions such as pension plan support. The following is a published performance report [28]. 

![Performance_dashboard](https://www.wavemoney.com.mm/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/htd_Jan_Sep2020info-Final_Eng.jpg)

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Wave Money remains the market leader and go-to payments operator across Myanmar, and the current disruption and impacts will eventually fade to see a return of the sector at strength. The key challenge at the moment remains how existing agents can support the run for cash given the current economic and political certainty and longer term brand damage that can be caused as certain agents demand higher withdrawal fees during times of crisis, potentially profiteering in times of need. As the market leader, Wave Money is much more susceptible.

#
## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
#
### Recommendation 1 - Further utilisation and expansion of big data

In 2018, Wave Money CEO Brad Jones indicated his desire for expansion into the insurance business, partnering with Yoma Bank [29]. As an extension and expansion of this, a recommendation is to further look at micro-finance, which fits the developing nation's demographic.  Part of the initial success of Wave Money was the fast and ingrated set up of the core banking systems by Telenor in partnership with Yoma Bank, its Myanmar partner. 

Jones has stated that Wave Money's job is "to acquire enough consumer data to make it useful for credit decisions" [30].  Partnering with the right providers can continue to improve the customer offers, for exanple, a Telenor Microfinance Bank product called "Easypaisa" operates as a branchless banking service. Easypaisa is driven by the bank's vision and mission of transforming the financial landscape of the country and providing instant access to convenient digital financial services, The company's services include micro-finance and related financial services to the less privileged and unbanked segment of the society, intended to contribute to the radication of poverty in Pakistan. This is now being repolicated with strategic partner Yoma Bank for Wave Money.

Taking this big data approach and utilising service partners further, a review of basic list of online services includes in the following table [31]; include core areas of opportunity are mainly found identified in the further extension of common banking products into the online app banking utilising key partnerships with Telenor (strategic partner) and Alibaba's Ant Group (soon to be 33% owner depending on political situation as at May 2021). The exploration of supporting new technologies that can provide reduced barriers to entry for new products (tech and cost) sucvh as artifical intelligence, automated processes, Banking as as Service, big data analysis and more [32].

![Recommendation_2_table](\Wave_Money_Recommendation_2_table.jpg)

Recommendation 2 - Continuity of service

Finally, a left field big idea. From a business perspective, Myanmar has a history of challenging political, economic, social and technological environment.  Politically, the disruption by the history of military coups and associated environmental uncertainty around the economic and legal framework which we take for granted within Australia, has meant that businesses have had to develop markets and operate day to day activities with a high level of risk and instability. 

Operating in a space of finance and technology, Wave Money is heavily reliant on the consistent and steady functioning of the country mobile infrastructure and internet providers. Telenor, a key provider of mobileinfrastructure and major partner in the Wave Money platform, has stated through their spokesperson Catherine Stand Lund, "we are worried about the situation in Myanmar. We have seen the difference access to communication technology can make in reducing inequalities and contributing to inclusive growth, and we want to contribute to the country’s progress" [33]

One of the particularly challenging aspects for a fintech operating in a country such as Myanmar is the military ruling government's capacity and willingness to shut down the Internet and heavily censor and vet the activities within the country.  James Griffiths noted to Al Jezeera that, "such blocks are relatively easy to achieve, especially when the government controls ISPs [internet service providers] which in the case of a military junta we must assume they do physically even if they don’t legally" [33]. 

The country's recent move in 2021 to implement new cyber-security laws would provide the military with unlimited power to access user data. Telenor has made a name for itself as the 'only transparent telecommunications company in Myanmar, providing regular updates on orders and directives it received from authorities, even ones it disagreed with.' On February 14 this year, hours before the internet shutdown, that came to an end. “It is currently not possible for Telenor to disclose the directives we receive from the authorities,” Telenor said in a statement, adding it was “gravely concerned by this development”' [33].

A possible avenue Wave Money could consider longer term is to continue to provide uninterrupted services to its customer base through the establishment of a low cost small satellite technology network similar to Starlink. Starlink provides "high-speed, low latency broadband internet, delivering initial beta service both domestically and internationally, and will continue expansion to near global coverage of the populated world in 2021. During beta, users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system.' [34] 

This kind of technology can provide cross border stable internet access, operating outside of the internal country's ISP network, this kind of set up could be administered from Telenor's neighbouring operations in Malaysia or another technology hub, allowing its Wave Money platform to continue to provide basic online transactional continuity. If worked and limited to financial services only, the military government's impact to this type of activity could be managed, or sidelined as more middle Asia offer, crossing borders, particularly given the political and financial strength of Serge Pun, then the transactional flow of money on the Wave Money platform could continue unimpeded by political unrest. 

Currently there are a multitude of space companies that are devloping low costs satellite access including Tesla and a new NZ based company Rocketlab, which has sending low cost low orbit payloads for over two years[35]. A company such Telenor could investigate leasing or procuring this types of technologies to support Wave Money.

## Conclusion

The enormous growth and revenue experienced by Wave Money in the period 2016 to 2021 demonstrates a well implemented and executed fintech product can reap incredible success, and as a purveyor of customer data, the future is certainly matching credible fintech service copmanies to their app platform . However, Telenor sum the current May 2021 Myanmar situation perfectly and demonstrate the challenges of operating within developing economies, and outside of a stable legal and political environment, for Telenor, Wave Money or any business, fintech or otherwise: 

"In Myanmar, we see an irregular, uncertain, and deeply concerning situation. Since the military coup on 1 February 2021, our focus has been on the security for our employees, access to services for customers and continued transparency. Prolonged mobile internet restrictions have severely connectivity services. Telenor calls on the authorities to immediately reinstate unimpeded communications and respect the right to freedom of expression and human rights. Due to the worsening of economic and business environment outlook and a deteriorating security and human rights situation, we see limited prospects of improvement going forward."
